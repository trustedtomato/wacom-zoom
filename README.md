# Wacom zoom
A simple script to zoom your Wacom tablet so that it only uses a part of the screen.

To run, make sure python3 is installed on your system. Then clone the repository or copy the python file to a file, make it executable and then run it with `./set-wacom.py zoom br --reset` to zoom the tablet to only use the bottom right quarter of your screen. For more options, consult `./set-wacom.py --help`
